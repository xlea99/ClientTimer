v0.1

-Initial version
-Can time multiple clients, add and remove clients at will. Times persist
over uses, but you can reset all times at any time.

v0.2

-Added support for shift clicking to run multiple timers at once. If you
simple click a start button, only that timer will start. However, if you shift
click a start button, it will begin that timer and not end currently active
timers.
-Stop buttons work the same way - simple clicking a stop button will end all
active timers. Shift clicking a stop button will end only that timer.

v0.3

-Switched all save files and config files to store in (User)/Documents/ICOMM Client Timer

v1.1

-Added +10 and -10 buttons. These buttons can be clicked at any time to add or remove 10 minutes
from any timer. Shift clicking each button will add or remove 1 minute instead.
-Made labels not dynamically resize between bolded and unbolded states.

v1.2

-Redid the GUI to be more compact, neat, and hopefully a little nicer to look at
-Added support for various themes and size configurations

-Added quick link to open Saved time folder in case manual editing of times is required
-Changed time increments to +5 and -5 per request

button on the far right of them.
-Few minor bugfixes
